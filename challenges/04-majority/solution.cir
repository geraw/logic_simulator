# Majority Bit Circuit Example Solution
# For each time step, output the majority of X1, X2, X3

# Macro definitions (using only NAND as a primitive gate)
NOT(x)      := NAND(x, x)
AND(x,y)    := NOT(NAND(x, y))
OR(x,y)     := NAND(NOT(x), NOT(y))

# Majority function for three bits: (A & B) | (A & C) | (B & C)
MAJ(a, b, c) := OR(OR(AND(a, b), AND(a, c)), AND(b, c))

Y = MAJ(X1, X2, X3)
