# Logic Circuit Simulator üîß

A command-line digital logic circuit simulator built in Python using the Lark parsing library. This tool parses and simulates circuit description files, allowing for the analysis of combinational and sequential logic circuits over time.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Declarative Syntax**: Describe circuits using a simple, human-readable text format.
* **Macro Support**: Define reusable components (like `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`) using a `:=` syntax.
* **Sequential Logic**: Built-in support for D-type flip-flops using `D(expr, default)` for time-delayed evaluation.
* **Combinational Logic**: Automatically resolves dependencies within a single time step.
* **Error Detection**: Detects basic combinational loops and provides clear syntax error reporting with line and column numbers.
* **Command-Line Interface**: Flexible CLI for specifying input sequences, output signals, and simulation duration.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* `lark` library

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd logic_simulator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install lark
    ```

## How to Run

The simulator is executed from the command line using `main.py`.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
python main.py <path_to_circuit_file> [options]
```

## Options

| Flag | Argument | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -i, --input | SIGNAL=SEQUENCE | Defines an input signal. Example: -i B=1011. Can be used multiple times for multiple inputs. |
| -o, --output | SIGNAL | Specifies a signal to display in the output. If omitted, all signals are shown. Can be used multiple times. |
| -s, --steps | NUMBER | Sets the total number of simulation steps. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the longest input sequence. |


## Circuit File Syntax (.cir)

Circuit files are text files that describe the components and connections of a logic circuit.

### Comments

Lines starting with # are treated as comments and are ignored.

```cir
# This is a comment
```

### Assignments (=)

Assignments define a signal (wire) as the output of an expression. The left side is the signal name, and the right side is the component's output.

```cir
# Signal 'A' is the output of a NAND gate with inputs 'B' and 'C'
A = NAND(B, C)
```

### Macro Definitions (:=)

Macros define reusable components. They are expanded into their base expressions during the initialization of the simulation.

```cir
# A 'NOT' gate is defined as a NAND gate with both inputs tied together
NOT(x) := NAND(x, x)

# An 'AND' gate can be defined using other macros
AND(x, y) := NOT(NAND(x, y))
```

## Core Components

The simulator has two fundamental, built-in components:

### üîß NAND(x, y)

The universal NAND gate. All other standard logic gates can be built from this.

### ‚è±Ô∏è D(expr, default)

A D-type flip-flop or delay element.

* expr: The expression to be evaluated in the previous time step
* default: The value to return at the very first time step (t=0), when there is no previous state

NOT(x)      := NAND(x, x)
AND(x,y)    := NOT(NAND(x, y))
OR(x,y)     := NAND(NOT(x), NOT(y))
XOR(x,y)    := OR(AND(x, NOT(y)), AND(NOT(x), y))

# An n-bit binary counter using D flip-flops and XOR gates
O0 = XOR(D(O0,0),I)
O1 = XOR(D(O1,0),  AND(D(O0,0),I))
O2 = XOR(D(O2,0), AND(D(O1,0), AND(D(O0,0),I)))
```

This example circuit file describes a 3-bit binary counter that increments its value on each clock cycle when the input signal `I` is high (`1`). The outputs `O0`, `O1`, and `O2` represent the least significant bit to the most significant bit of the counter, respectively. The counter uses D flip-flops to store its state and NAND gates to determine the next state based on the current state and the input signal. The macros defined at the beginning of the file allow for the use of standard logic gates like `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` using only the primitive `NAND` gate.

# Example Usage
To simulate the counter circuit defined in `counter.cir`, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py counter.cir -i I=0010010100101111
```
This command sets the input signal `I` to a specific sequence of bits, simulating the counter's behavior over time. The output will display the state of all signals in the circuit at each time step, allowing you to observe how the counter increments its value based on the input signal.
The output will look something like this:

```
Parsing circuit file: counter.cir...
Initializing simulator and expanding macros...
Running simulation for 16 steps...
------------------------------
Simulation Complete!
------------------------------
Inputs:
  I    : 0010010100101111

Outputs & Internal Signals:
  O0   : 0011100111001010
  O1   : 0000011111000110
  O2   : 0000000000111110
```

This output shows the input sequence for signal `I` and the resulting sequences for the output signals `O0`, `O1`, and `O2` over the 16 simulation steps. Each output signal represents a bit of the binary counter, demonstrating how it increments in response to the input signal.
